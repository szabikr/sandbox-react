# Scroll Element into View

This project is the result of a technical spike and it's about to scroll different sections of the website into view after the respected navigation item has been clicked.

I used `useRef` hook to gain access to the DOM element which I can call `scrollIntoView` function on a click event. This hook is one of the escape hatches of React.

### Run the Project

```
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
