# Quote Analyser

Simple website that analyses quotes. Initially, it takes a quote from Ye himself, but you're also able to write any quote you want. Once the quote is established that needs analysing it takes the words apart and defines a list that contains all unique words. As a user you are able to click any of the words and get a description of the meaning of the word with some examples.
