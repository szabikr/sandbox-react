Display a list of items preferably from an API and add list filtering mechanisms

For example

- Filter by name
- Filter by favourites

I should do this project with `yarn` instead of `npm`.

Look into wether the `useMemo` is a good idea here for doing the filtering.

There should be some performance implication when running the filter function on the sandboxes in the JSX. Well not with 9 elements on the page, but if we had more.
